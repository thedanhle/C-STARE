# C-STARE
SOFWERX Fall 2020 Internship

Goal: 
The goal of the Facial Recognition Project is to create body-worn technology that disrupts the facial recognition coming from a camera. 
The two main options that the team is pushing are clothing or personal wear. The current status of this project states that the operators 
will be wearing biking clothes, so the goal is to build a solution surrounding biking attire. The team will keep in mind options that may 
also support the RF Signal Team and the Cloud Team.
