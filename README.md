# C-STARE
SOFWERX Fall 2020 Internship

##Goal:
The goal of the Facial Recognition Project is to create body-worn technology that disrupts the facial recognition software coming from a camera. The two main options that the team is pursuing are clothing or personal wear. The team will keep in mind future options that may also support the RF Signal Team and the Cloud Team.

##**Scenario:**
Operators are looking for an adversary base in an urban area, but only have general locations for where it could be.
A small team of operators is sent to survey an area and are staying at a local hotel.
Each person on the team will carry individual kits that can detect, identify, and locate RF transmissions of IoT-like devices.
The operators must return to the hotel every night.
The operators must disrupt facial recognition capabilities in a discrete way.

##**Project Model:**
For this project, the team used the following model:
- Learn the basics of what facial recognition / machine learning is.
- Learn the basics of Linux to operate our machines.
- Learn how to implement machine learning algorithms and neural networks into a program to create our own facial recognition program.
- Research possible solutions to defeat facial recognition and identification.
- Narrow down probable solutions based off of past experimentation and our current resources.
- Select favorable subjects of testing: Infrared LEDs, Adversarial Images, Masks.
- Test each subject for proof of concept.
- Claim results.
- Document results.
